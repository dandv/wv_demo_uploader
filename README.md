## Weaviate demo data uploader

Script(s) to make it easier to upload various (small) datasets to experiment with Weaviate

### TODO


#### Priorities
- Add tests
- Confirm upload 
- Explore how to prevent OpenAI timeout if using a trial key

#### Later
- Add options for other APIs (e.g. Cohere)
- Add options for local Weaviate instance
- Add query scripts
- Add ways for users to try out larger versions of each dataset

#### Maybe
- Add front end with demo queries?
